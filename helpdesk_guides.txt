12.	Ultimately, if needed please delete and re-download the app. 
13.	If all above fails, have the guest log in on your own personal device, or another device from someone else in their party, to see if the issue is isolated to their device or their account. 

Please note the Royal App won’t work for pier add-on guests, or whose bookings are in waitlist status on AS-400, as some Friends & Family bookings are. 
Guest can’t make reservations, view folio, use chat, view photos, but is already properly connected: 
1.	On the **GA Tool** [Trigger: GA Tool], enter the guest’s e-mail > tap on the blue link > Upcoming cruises > check if the correct name is 

2.	selected on the current cruise. If you can’t see a blue dot to select, inform AFDM and try logging in with another user. 
3.	If multiple names on the same cruise among different bookings are selected, please un-select the incorrect name(s). 

4.	If the correct name is already selected, tap on Unlink, and manually link the booking again on the **GA Tool** [Trigger: GA Tool]. Close and re-open the app to retest. 

Guest has a grayed-out Reserve Now button with a “Your account is on hold” message: 

1.	Refresh guest’s folio in Fidelio. Check their charging privileges. 
2.	If they still can’t reserve on the app, IT will need to refresh/repush their folio. In the meantime, use Hybris IBT to make the necessary bookings for the guests. 
3.	Also check if the guest correctly connect to wifi and linked on **GA Tool** [Trigger: GA Tool]

Guest would like to use chat with their children: 
1.	Please remind guests that for the company to comply with COPPA (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule), guests under 13 years old cannot create an account on the Royal App, and therefore cannot use chat. There isn’t a workaround for this. 
2.	Exceptions to this age restriction apply to guests from: 

3.	Austria – 14 years old 
4.	Germany, Hungary, Lithuania, Netherlands – 16 years old 



Guest is trying to book an activity for multiple guests but gets an error message at the end of the booking flow: 
1.	That specific time slot is probably unavailable for their whole party. Check Hybris IBT to indicate to the guest which time slots are still available for booking that would accommodate their whole party. 

Guest can’t enter a new password on the app after their password was reset on the Guest Account Admin Tool: 
1.	On the **GA Tool** [Trigger: GA Tool], ensure you see a successful green bar after resetting the account’s password. If not, try using a new password, using a different browser, using incognito mode, or clearing the browser’s cache. 
2.	Sometimes the app will take several trials of entering the new password from the Admin Tool to finally let the guest enter their preferred password. If needed, reset the password again. 
3.	An alternative is to login to their account on royalcaribbean.com/account, enter the password from the Admin Tool, and then enter the guest’s desired new password. 
4.	If you need to rese the password again, do not use the one that you just entered. Pick a different new password.

Guest can’t see chat messages, or can’t accept an invitation: 
1.	If the chat screen just shows a circle spinning, check if the app version is the latest version available. If not, update it. 
2.	Check if each guest is logging in with their own e-mail address, and their accounts are associated to the correct names on the **GA Tool** [Trigger: GA Tool]. 
3.	Check if the device’s time & date are accurate. 
4.	If an invitation couldn’t be accepted, delete the pending invitation from the other guest, ensure guests have the be found toggle on, and have the other guest invite them again. 
5.	If Guest 1 accepted an invitation but Guest 2 still sees that guest grayed out as Invitation Pending, have both guests sign out of their apps. Have Guest 2 sign in with their account on Guest 1’s device (or another device). If allowed, invite Guest 1 again. 
6.	If a guest can’t see invitations or messages sent from others, reset their password and log in on their account from your own personal device, or from another guest’s device. Accept the invitation and/or send a message, and have the guest log back in on their app. 

Guest isn’t receiving notifications for chat: 
1.	Turn off any Silence, Do Not Disturb or Power Saving modes. 
2.	Check if notification permissions are on for the app on Settings > Notifications > Royal. 
3.	Forget the WiFi-Guest-”SHIP_NAME” connection, go to login.com, and re-authenticate the guests under their Voom account or by choosing Use the app for free. 
4.	If issue persists, delete and re-download the app. Please note there is a fleetwide known issue that some devices will still not display push/native chat notifications outside of the app. 
I am sending a message, but person I am sending sees it like coming from someone else:
1.	Please open the **GA Tool** [Trigger: GA Tool] (Guest Admin Tool)
2.	Enter the mail address of the person who was sending the message. Click the blue link.
3.	Navigate to the upcoming cruises
4.	And check if the correct name has been selected. If not select the correct name and save it.
5.	Sign out and sign back in to the app from the person’s phone.

Guest is in a suite and can’t use stateroom controls on the app: 
1.	When tapping “Stateroom”, all staterooms have the feature to use the app as a TV remote, but Junior Suite and higher can also control AC, lights, and window/balcony blinds. 
2.	However, there is a fleetwide known issue that most iPhones will get an error screen when tapping on “Stateroom” on the app. There are no troubleshooting steps to fix it 

Guest can’t see their loyalty points or tier on the app: 
1.	Search the C&A number on the **GA Tool** [Trigger: GA Tool] and see the quantity of points shown. If the app doesn’t display the same, check their email account on the app and look it up on the tool. 
2.	Confirm the correct C&A number is linked to their account. If it’s already correct, refresh the account: remove the C&A number, hit Save, and add it back. All data needs to match. 
3.	If there is any name or DOB discrepancy between C&A number and guest account, please amend the guest account as necessary. If Siebel’s data is inaccurate, advise Loyalty Amb. 

Guest sees a “dark room” message when trying to see photos: 
1.	Ensure the correct name is linked on the **GA Tool**. If it is, unlink the booking, re-link and ask guests to wait 30 minutes. If other bookings for the current cruise are linked, unlink them. 
2.	If the issue persists, request IT to restart the photograph server, and advise guests it will take a while between this restart and photos becoming available on the app. In the meantime, they can see their photos on the kiosks at the Photo Gallery. 
3.	Ask guests to sign out and back in on the app. 

Guest is a back-to-back cruiser and can’t check-in on the app: 
1.	Check-in on the Royal App is only available up until 48 hours before embarkation and can only be done while connected to the guest’s own internet connection. It can’t be done while connected to WiFi-Guest-”SHIP_NAME”. 

2.	Guest is using the Royal App on an iPad/tablet: 
3.	We do not support tablets. There are no troubleshooting steps to be taken. 

Guest can’t find the Royal App to download from the App/Google Play Stores, or can’t download it from the free link on Captive Portal (login.com): 
1.	The current Operating System minimum requirements for devices to be able to download and use the Royal App are iOS 16 for iPhones, and Android 7.0 and up. 
2.	On iPhones, check the device’s OS in Settings > General > About > Software version. On Androids, check Settings > About phone > Software information > Android version. 
3.	If the OS requirements are met but the App still can’t be downloaded, ensure the device’s time & date are accurate. 

Guest gets a Sorry, download failed message when trying to download the app from captive portal: 
1.	Have the guest fill their information as requested. 
2.	On the iCafe Dashboard, search for the guest’s last name (as they entered on the “Download failed” screen) with Anonymous as their cabin number. 
3.	Go to Status > tap on Reset user’s app download plan limit. This will give 2 more sessions of 15 minutes each. 
4.	If the download stops after 15 minutes, tap on Download or update the app for free on Captive Portal again for the second 15-minute session, and the download will continue from there. 

If a guest leaves the desk without a resolution: 
•	We must manage the guests’ expectations that if all above troubleshooting steps were taken and the issue persists, it could be a particular device issue that unfortunately is out of our control. Please ask for their permission to reset their guest account’s password and inform them their issue will be sent to our shoreside support team for investigation. Without this permission, most issues can’t be sent to shoreside. Please inform them our shoreside support team will do their best but not necessarily will be able to resolve their issue during the cruise. 

•	If you suspect there may be a technical issue affecting multiple or all guests (for example, guests were kicked out of the app and can’t login, or can’t use chat), please call the Digital Manager on 55500 on the spot so a critical Pager Duty can be opened with the shoreside support team. 

•	COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act) which states (simplified) that children under the age of 13 are not allowed to have an online account. 
•	General rule
•	All countries: 13 years or older*
•	Exceptions
